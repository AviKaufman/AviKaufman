Hi, Iâ€™m Avi Kaufman â€” a passionate problem solver with a relentless curiosity and a drive to shape the future. Iâ€™m graduating from the University of Iowa in May 2025 with a triple major in Computer Science, Physics, and Mathematics.

My interests lie at the intersection of deep theory and cutting-edge innovation, with a particular focus on quantum computing. Whether Iâ€™m analyzing quantum systems, building efficient algorithms, or diving into software development, I thrive on tackling complex problems and pushing boundaries.

Outside of academics and research, Iâ€™ve explored entrepreneurial ventures, where I bring creative ideas to life through tech. I believe in solving tomorrowâ€™s problems today, and Iâ€™m always looking for new challenges that stretch my skills and expand my understanding.

If youâ€™re passionate about building the future, weâ€™ll get along just fine. ðŸ˜ƒ
